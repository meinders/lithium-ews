## About this document

This document describes (part of) the file format used by [EasyWorship][] to
store schedules.

[easyworship]: http://easyworship.com/  "EasyWorship Church Presentation Software"

Schedule files are written in a binary file format. There is no official
documentation, nor are there any tools provided with EasyWorship to convert
between schedule files and other (preferably open) file formats. This
specification is intended to enable (at least some) interoperability between
EasyWorship and other software, such as tools to import content.

The information in this document was derived by inspecting schedule files with
a hex-editor. No attempts were made to reverse engineer, decompile or
disassemble the software itself.


## Conventions and data types

This section covers some basic conventions about notations and data types used
in this specification.

Number literals prefixed with '0x' are written in hexadecimal. All other numbers
are written in decimal notation.

Integers types are written as 'int' and the number of bits used, followed by
either 'le' for little-endian byte order, or 'be' for big-endian. For example,
'int32le' indicates a 32-bit integer with little-endian byte order.

Colors types are written using as the color components (red, green, blue and
alpha) in the byte order used in the file. For example 'bgra' for a 4-byte color
consisting of blue, green, red and alpha, in that order.

Floating point types are written as 'float' and the number of bits used.
Byte order is always little-endian. For example, 'float32' for a common
single-precision (32-bit) floating point value.

Strings are written as simply 'string' for fixed-size strings or 'cstring' for
null-terminated strings. The length specified for cstrings *excludes* the
trailing null character.

Timestamps, written as 'datetime', are stored as 64-bit floating point values.
The value specifies the number of days since 1 January 1900. Using this
notation, the time is simply a fraction of a day. Apparently this is how
[Excel has done it for years][exceldate], and I guess it leaked into .NET.

# File structure

Schedule files consist of a header, a list of schedule entries and the content
referenced by the schedule entries. The sections below describe each of these
blocks in detail.

    +--------+----------------+-- - -    - - --+---------+-- - -    - - --+
    | Header | Schedule entry | (more entries) | Content | (more content) |
    +--------+----------------+-- - -    - - --+---------+-- - -    - - --+

Note that the meaning of much of the file format remains unknown, because that
content was constant in all examined files. The contents of the unknown fields
can simply be copied from an arbitrary schedule file.


## Header

The header specifies the file format and version, as well as the layout of the
following schedule entries. The remaining content in the header is unknown.

For version 5, the header is as follows.

    Offset  Field              Data type    Length    Details
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         0  Filetype           string           38    Specifies the file type and version.
                                                      "EasyWorship Schedule File Version    5"

        56  Entry count        int32le           4    Number of items in the schedule
        60  Entry length       int16le           2    Length of schedule entries: 0x0718 = 1816

For version 3, the header is as follows.

    Offset  Field              Data type    Length    Details
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         0  Filetype           string           38    Specifies the file type and version.
                                                      "EasyWorship Schedule File Version    3"

        48  Entry count        int32le           4    Number of items in the schedule
        52  Entry length       int16le           2    Length of schedule entries: 0x05f8 = 1528

For version 1.6, the header is as follows.

    Offset  Field              Data type    Length    Details
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         0  Filetype           string           38    Specifies the file type and version.
                                                      "EasyWorship Schedule File Version  1.6"

        40  Entry count        int32le           4    Number of items in the schedule
        44  Entry length       int16le           2    Length of schedule entries: 0x0350 = 848


## Schedule entry

A schedule entry specifies the title of an item and the location of its content.
There's also a timestamp, which appears to be the modification time of the
content.

Offsets are relative to the start of the schedule entry. The first entry starts
directly after the header.

Any gaps between fields are filled with null characters.

    Offset  Field                  Data type    Length    Details
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         0  Title                  cstring          50

## Text content

Text content is compressed using the [deflate][] compression algorithm. Song
lyrics are stored in [Rich Text Format][rtf]. Characters appear to be encoded as
bytes using system default character set, in my case 'windows-1252'.

The compressed content is followed by an [Adler-32][] checksum.

## Binary content

Images and videos are not compressed. As a result the structure that stores them
is pretty straightforward.

    Offset  Field              Data type    Length    Details
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         0  Length             int32le           4    Length (L) of the content.
         4  Content            string            L


## Presentation

In addition to the presentation itself, which is stored as binary contents
(see above), the schedule file also contains preview images of each slide.
